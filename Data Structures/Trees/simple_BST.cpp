binary search tree:
Binary Search Trees are a non-linear data structure, it have 2 propertiesthe:
left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key, while the right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
In most cases, the time complexity of operations on a BST, which include, lookups, insertions and deletions, take O(log N) time
