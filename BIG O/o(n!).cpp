/******************************************************************************

O(1) Constant- no loops
O(log N) Logarithmic- usually searching algorithms have log n if they are sorted (Binary Search)
O(n) Linear- for loops, while loops through n items
O(n log(n)) Log Liniear- usually sorting operations
O(n^2) Quadratic- every element in a collection needs to be compared to ever other element. Two
nested loops
O(2^n) Exponential- recursive algorithms that solves a problem of size N
O(n!) Factorial- you are adding a loop for every element
Iterating through half a collection is still O(n)
Two separate collections: O(a * b)

     the time complexity of a function called in a loop affects the time complexity of the loop,
     If the loop is executed n times and the function in the loop executes (n-1)! steps, 
     then a total of n * (n-1)! = n! steps will be performed. 
     Which is exactly how you proof that this function's time complexity is in Î˜(n!)
